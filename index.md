# About
Hello I'm Kris Haro. I am a current Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Oregon State University with a minor in Computer Science. My interests in this major include embedded systems, software engineering, and computer architecture. Though I have more education with hardware, I prefer the software side of this major.

# Languages
**C**
- Have used C in a wide range of tasks
- Created a small bash shell
- Programmed AVR microcontollers (ATmega128 and ATmega328p)

**C++**
- Used in introductory CS classes to work on data structures and algorithms.
- Also used to program AVR microntollers when direct register control was not required.

**MATLAB**
- Used primarily to graph data collected from other parts of a project.

**Assembly**
- AVR instruction set
- Used in previous computer organization class to work on a lab kit built on the ATmega128
- Familiar with Microchip Studio

**Python**
- Newest language learned, currently tweaking a Discord bot to use in a server with my friends.

__Curenntly learning: HTML & CSS to eventually make this website truly mine!__

# Projects
Each one of my larger scale projects has their own dedicated website. Go check them out! I'll be adding a website for the Discord bot soon.
